We want clear responsibility on what decides vs do a give update / upgrade.

The update service decides who should upgrade to what based on rules.
These rules include what to do for new instances.
The upgrade service is in control of the upgrade speed.

[NOTE]
====
Note that the update service does not exist yet today and is done by the fleet manager.
====

Fleet manager is responsible for converting the upgrade service intent into ManagedCR changes.

Fleet shard is responsible for executing the upgrade requested.
